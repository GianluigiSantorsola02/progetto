# Command Service

The CommandService provides methods for running system commands from the Kura web console or from a cloud platform. Currently it is supported in Everyware Cloud. In the Kura web console, the service is available clicking on the **Command** tab under the **Device** section, while for the cloud platform please refer to the official documentation.

To run a command simply fill the **Execute** field with the command and click the **Execute** button.
The service also provides the ability for a script to execute using the **File** option of the **Command** tab in the Kura web console or the Everyware Cloud Console. This script must be compressed into a zip file with the eventual, associated resource files.

Once the file is selected and **Execute** is clicked, the zip file is sent embedded in an MQTT message on the device. The  Command Service in the device stores the file in /tmp, unzips it, and tries to execute a shell script if one is present in the file. Note that in this case, the Execute parameter cannot be empty; a simple command, such as "ls -l /tmp", may be entered.

The configuration of the service is in the **CommandService** tab located in the **Services** area as shown in the screen capture below.

The CommandService provides the following configuration parameters:

- **Command Enable** - sets whether this service is enabled or disabled in the cloud platform. (Required field.)

- **Command Password Value** - sets a password to protect this service.

- **Command Working Directory** - specifies the working directory where the command execution is performed.

- **Command Timeout** - sets the timeout (in seconds) for the command execution.

- **Command Environment** - supplies a space-separated list of environment variables in the format key=value.

- **Privileged/Unprivileged Command Service Selection** - sets the modality of the command service. When set to privileged, the commands are run using the (privileged) user that started Kura, tipically *kurad* or *root*. When set to unprivileged, a standard user will run the commands, tipically *kura*.

    Only the RaspberryPi profiles support the unprivileged command service.
  
When a command execution is requested in the cloud platform, it sends an MQTT control message to the device requesting that the command be executed. On the device, the Command Service opens a temporary shell in the _command.working.directory,_ sets the _command.environment_ variables (if any), and waits  _command.timeout_ seconds to get command response.
